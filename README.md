Tutorial to build upon Ethereum DEXes

Summary: 
* [Part 1: Get the rates with a DEX aggregator](https://ethereumdev.io/trading-and-arbitrage-on-ethereum-dex-get-the-rates-part-1/)

Quick and dirty build:

You'll need node.js installed and a way to access the blockchain in order to make web3 RPC calls.  I set up a free Infura account for this purpose: (https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/b173657a332241d192ae1d1588efde68)

To compile: From the head of the repo, cd to part1, type "npm install".  When the installation is completed, cd to part2, type "npm install".  Voila!
